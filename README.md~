This project will be a website for a Nutrition Advice Company. It will include the typical business required pages (ex. About Us),but it wil also include a login and a forum. USers will be able to create a profile with their body measurements, goals, and diets. They can then share this information on the forums. Where others can comment on the diet of the original poster and offer advice. I will be using authentication , bootstrap, and Sass.

User Story:
As a user, I want to get advice on my diet and nutrition goals.
I will first create a login account, entering a username, password, body measurements, and goals.
On the forum, I can then look through other users diets and a goals and give them advice, or I can post my own goals and diets to recieve advice.
I can view my posts by going to my profile page, or if my goals, diet, or body measurements change these from my profile page as well.

Authentication:
It allows the creation of users and logins. I will use the passport modules and session middleware. This will allow users to have individual experiences on the webpage and manage their own information and forum posts as they see fit.  

BootStrap:
BootStrap is a CSS framework. It allows those who either don't have the skill or time to create an individualized CSS stylesheet to have access to an aestheticly pleasing, effiecient, and useful CSS styling. I will install grunt and install bootstrap from there. I will probably use a template but modify it to suit my needs and my style. I am usually this mainly to have a more pleasing CSS stylesheet for my website.

Sass:
Sass allows the preprocessing of CSS and the inclusion of variables into CSS. This works well with bootstrap to create overall better and more dynamc CSS styles.TO get Sass to work I must install ruby irst then install Sass to my project directory.
